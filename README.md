A fast-paced 3D arcade game, built in Unity 6.2. Players control a bouncing ball constrained to the surface of a transparent cylinder, dodging hazards and chaining bounces for high scores.

## üöÄ About This Project

**Circle Jump** is an experimental 3D game that combines physics-based platforming with cylindrical world traversal. The player takes control of a ball that moves around the circumference of a giant transparent cylinder, bouncing off blocks and avoiding hazards.  

The game is designed as both a **learning project in Unity 6.2 (6000.2.1f1)** and a future release candidate for **Steam** and **WebGL**. It demonstrates advanced Unity concepts such as custom coordinate systems, cylindrical movement, physics-driven interactions, and scalable difficulty systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unity 6.2 (6000.2.1f1)** | Core game engine for 3D world building and physics. |
| **C#** | Primary language for gameplay scripting and mechanics. |
| **Unity Input System** | Handles cross-platform input for keyboard, mouse, and gamepad. |
| **URP (Universal Render Pipeline)** | For performant graphics and visual effects. |
| **Cinemachine** | Camera control and smooth player follow system. |
| **Steamworks.NET** | Planned integration for achievements, leaderboards, and Steam deployment. |
| **WebGL Build Support** | For deploying a browser-playable version of the game. |
